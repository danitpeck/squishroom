# Development

## Workflow
- Run tests before pushing: `npm run test`.
- Add or update tests for any new behavior.
- Keep tests small and fast; prefer pure logic in `src` that is easy to verify.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` for local development.
- `npm run build` to verify production output.
- `npm run test` for CI-style test runs.
- `npm run test:watch` during active changes.
